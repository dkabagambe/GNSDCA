                <p class="about-paragraph">
                  Founded in 2021, the Global North and South Movement on
                  Climate Action is a global movement of youth and youth
                  networks from the Global North and South striving to create
                  unified voice perspectives around five main thematic focus
                  areas. Working with several institutional partners from
                  Academia, Community-Based Organizations, Non-Governmental and
                  Inter-governmental Agencies, Private Sector Actors, we believe
                  the climate crisis is a global concern and can only be
                  addressed by joint action and unified stances.
                </p>
                <h3 class="about-title">Our work and mandate</h3>
                <p class="about-paragraph">
                  Climate Change negotiations at different levels including
                  UNFCCC COP still continue to yield minimal results and
                  progress due to non-consensus between parties majorly the
                  Global North and Global South but also due to lack of
                  political will among others. Through our global dialogue
                  series, we bring forth intergenerational dialogues and
                  perspectives, fostering robust and intense learning, steering
                  collaboration, building solidarity to understand the systemic
                  climate risks and challenges affecting our individual
                  communities.

    <!-- [7:19 pm, 24/05/2023] Erasto: Participation
We are to have regional representatives at least two from each continent, and these  regional representatives are to work hand in hand with the country representatives at least one from each country. We are also to take on a multi-sectoral approach; working with some key professionals in the climate space from various backgrounds like faith institutions, school/universities, private sector, among other sectors.
[7:20 pm, 24/05/2023] Erasto: Goal
To harmonise climate action and climate activists’ concerns between the global North and Global south youth.
Objectives:
The core objectives of the dialogue include;
•     	To amplify and unify the voices of Climate Activists globally with the purpose of having a shared voice  towards climate action 
•     	To institutionalise, build the capacity of climate activists and advocates around the World to understand the systemic climate issues, lead on local climate action; on mitigation, adaptation and nationally determined contribution concepts for climate just communities.
•     	To influence, through a unified voice, World Leaders to unite and act swiftly towards establishment of clear safeguards and mandates to fast-track the implementation of the Paris Agreement and several other international conventions.
[7:20 pm, 24/05/2023] Erasto: Who we are 
We are young people from vast backgrounds both from the global North and the global South who met at COP 26 and COP 27, realized a gap concerning climate action; how other young people at the Grassroots are also brought on board for their voices to be heard and hence we decided to have the global North and Global South Dialogue on climate action that will help achieve this objective and also have a broader impact concerning climate action. Despite all our organizations and entities that we represent we decided to have this dialogue for a global North and Global South as young people but not as the organizations that we represent.
